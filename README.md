# CliHack
Command Line Hack for Social Utilities and Entertainment.
Since running common tasks on GUI is too main stream, we wanted to play around with the terminal to 
try and perform as many common tasks via the command line without lifting your hands of the keyboard.

#App
The app is a terminal window that is split into multiple panes, each running a unique task. We implement 
the following functionalities via command line:
1. Sending SMS to a contact on your Google Account
2. Automatically send Birthday Wishes via SMS to people having birthdays on the current day
3. Stream spotify music with play, pause, next, previous controls.
4. A pac-man game for whiling away time
5. Gmail inbox with all functionalities
6. Play a video from youtube in ASCII
