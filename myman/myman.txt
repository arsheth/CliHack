DESCRIPTION
       Basic premise of the MyMan video game:

              “Those scary monsters are back, and this  time  they've  spotted
              you!  What's  worse  is  that they've mistaken you for their old
              rival Pac, and they're out for (yellow) blood!”

       This is a fast-paced video game using the curses(3) library to  display
       on a text terminal or terminal emulator.

   VERSION
       This manual page was generated for myman 0.7.1. Please check the output
       of myman --version to make sure you're using a corresponding version of
       the myman program.

   GETTING STARTED
       Start  playing  MyMan  by  typing myman (to play MyMan on a text termi‐
       nal or terminal emulator), or xmyman  (to  play  MyMan  in  full  color
       inside  a  new  window under the X Window System.) Move MyMan using the
       arrow keys. The alternate keys H, J, K, and L are available for vi  (1)
       users.   The  alternate  keys  Ctrl-B,  Ctrl-N,  Ctrl-P, and Ctrl-F are
       available for emacs (1) users.  Press the Q key at any  time  to  quit.
       If the flashing power pellets are too small, run myman with the -o com‐
       mand-line parameter or press O or 0 during the game.  If the maze walls
       are  invisible or garbled, run myman with the -a command-line parameter
       or press A during the game.

   ADVANCED
       See below, especially the OPTIONS and USAGE sections.

       myman  The myman program plays the MyMan video  game.   myman  runs  in
              text  mode and displays on a text terminal or terminal emulator.
              myman includes several maze variants inspired by similar  games,
              and  an  alternative  ASCII-art  display mode suitable for large
              terminal screens.

       xmyman, xmyman2, xmyman3, xmyman4, xbigman,  xhugeman,  xbitman,  xbit‐
       man2, xbitman3, xbitman4, xbitman5, xbitman6, and xquackman
              The  xmyman,  xbigman,  xhugeman,  xbitman,  xbitman2, xbitman3,
              xbitman4,  xbitman5,  xbitman6,  xquackman  and  xmyman3   shell
              scripts  are  wrappers  used to launch myman inside a new window
              under the X Window system with approporiate  colors  and  fonts.
              They accept all of myman's options. They use either PDCurses for
              X (a.k.a. XCurses) or the xterm(1) terminal emulator to open the
              new window.

              The  xmyman2  shell  script  is  similar to xmyman, but uses the
              rxvt(1) terminal emulator instead of xterm(1).

              The xmyman3 shell script is similar  to  xmyman,  but  uses  the
              kterm(1) terminal emulator instead of xterm(1).

              The xmyman and xmyman2 shell scripts use altcharset translations
              (VT100-style graphics). The xmyman3 script uses raw tile charac‐
              ters  (CP437  or  UCS/Unicode  character  graphics.) The xmyman4
              script uses raw tile characters (EUC-JP character graphics.) The
              xbigman  script  uses  large tiles and sprites (ASCII-art) for a
              more authentic appearance, but this means you either see less of
              the game or need to use a larger terminal emulator window (typi‐
              cally with a small font size.) The  xhugeman  script  uses  even
              larger ASCII-art and is usable only on high-resolution displays.
              The xbitman, xbitman3 and  xbitman5  scripts  use  ASCII-art  or
              UCS/Unicode  graphics  to  approximate a bitmap display, and are
              only usable on high-resolution displays. The xbitman2,  xbitman4
              and  xbitman6  scripts  use ASCII-art or UCS/Unicode graphics to
              approximate a bitmap display, and are only usable on very  high-
              resolution  displays.  The  xquackman script behaves like xmyman
              but selects maze, tile and sprites  similar  to  those  used  in
              YumPop.com's `Quackman'

              Any necessary terminal emulators and fonts must be installed and
              properly configured for these shell scripts to work.

       myman.ct
              The myman.ct ctheme script reconfigures  the  Linux  console  or
              xterm(1) color palette for use with myman.

EXIT STATUS
       0      Exit  status  zero indicates normal completion of the myman pro‐
              gram.

       1      Exit status one indicates an incomplete or damaged  installation
              or  another abnormal situation causing the myman program to exit
              unexpectedly.

       2      Exit status two indicates that unrecognized or unsupported  com‐
              mand-line parameters were given to myman.

       other  In  some  cases  the xmyman, xmyman2, xmyman3, xmyman4, xbigman,
              xhugeman, xbitman, xbitman2, xbitman3, xbitman4, xbitman5, xbit‐
              man6,  and  xquackman  scripts may exit with another status as a
              result of inability to connect to an  X  Window  System  display
              server,  or  as a result of inability to start a terminal emula‐
              tor. Receipt of an unhandled signal may  cause  the  process  to
              exit with some other status.

OPTIONS
       The  following options are accepted by myman, xmyman, xmyman2, xmyman3,

SECURITY
       Although no vulnerabilities are known, it is recommended that myman and
       related programs not be installed setuid-root.

CONFORMING TO
       This is still considered a non-standard command, but by  installing  it
       you bring us one step closer to world domination.

NOTES
       The  -o  option  or the O or 0 command is frequently needed for correct
       display.

BUGS
       Probably lots. Some of the more annoying known bugs:

       Broken or Missing Character Graphics (i.e. Mangled Maze Walls)
              MyMan uses character graphics to  represent  maze  walls,  power
              pellets,  and  other  graphic  elements. Usually these character
              graphics are rendered using altcharset translations (VT100-style
              graphics,)  but they can be rendered using ASCII-art or raw tile
              characters (either CP437 bytes or UCS/Unicode characters.)

              For these character graphics to be displayed  properly,  several
              pieces  of software must work together: myman(6), curses(3), and
              a text terminal or terminal emulator  (including  any  necessary
              fonts.)   Interactions  between  these pieces of software may be
              affected by environment variables, locale(7) settings,  command-
              line  parameters, other configuration settings, and perhaps even
              the occultation of natural satellites.  A  misalignment  between
              two  of  these pieces can cause the character graphics to become
              garbled, or even cause them to disappear entirely.

              You may work around these problems by using the -a option or the
              A command to switch to plain ASCII-art.

       Buggy Monster Behavior
              The  monsters sometimes become lost and are unable to find their
              way home, or fail to  follow  the  player  into  obvious  hiding
              places. Some mazes confuse the monsters more than others.

       Lacking Standard Documentation Formats
              There  should  be  a  Texinfo manual for MyMan, and some sort of
              human-readable manual should be included in the source distribu‐
              tion.

       Inaccurate Status Line in HTML and text Screenshots
              The  screenshot  mechanism does not accurately reflect the over‐
              laying of the status line on top of the maze, so the screen shot
              may be one line too tall, and will include any parts of the maze
              that are actually obscured by the status line.

       Inaccurate HTML and text Screenshots
              The HTML and text screenshots record MyMan's internal  represen‐
              tation of the terminal screen, which may not agree with what you
              see in terms of  graphic  characters  (actual  rendering  varies
              among  terminals and across curses implementations,) color (some
              terminals and curses libraries don't support  palette  manipula‐
              tion,)  and  font  (MyMan has no way to guess what your terminal
              font looks like.)

              Also, different web browsers and fonts will affect rendering  of
              the screenshot itself. Some browsers and fonts render line-draw‐
              ing graphics characters at different visual  widths  from  plain
              ASCII characters. Other browsers substitute their own inadequate
              ASCII replacements. A few web browsers  are  unable  to  display
              line-drawing  graphics characters at all, or require the user to
              manually select the “User Defined” encoding.

              If your terminal is configured to use raw CP437 tile characters,
              the  screenshot will contain raw CP437 data.  Otherwise UCS/Uni‐
              code numeric character references will be used and the  document
              will  be  labeled  as  UTF-8.  Some  web browsers do not support
              CP437, others do not support  numeric  character  references  in
              UTF-8, and still others support neither!

              You  may work around these problems using the -a option or the A
              command to switch to plain ASCII-art and the -n option or the  C
              command  to  disable color before taking a screenshot to be sure
              that what you see is what you get.

HISTORY
       MyMan was written on a dare on Sunday, 1998-06-28. The original version
       had no color or  attribute  support  and  only  supported  large  tiles
       (equivalent  to -z big.) It was 742 lines of ANSI C and used three data
       files: a maze file (equivalent to -v pac), a tile  file  and  a  sprite
       file.  It  worked  with ncurses on Linux and cygwin. Several variations
       using other maze layouts were created over the following  hours.  Color
       came  in December of that year, as did support for small tiles (equiva‐
       lent to -z small.) The my_getopt argument parser is a bit older, having
       been started in 1997 as part of the SMOKE-16 project.

ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS
       Toru  Iwatani  had  the original idea for Namco's `Pac-Man'/`Puck-Man',
       which in turn served as inspiration for this game.  Innumerable  others
       have  written  their  own  variants  of the original game which in turn
       inspired variants for this game, and I have tried to credit them  where
       authorship is known. Credits for each variant are listed in the in-game
       help screen reachable by pressing ? or Ctrl-H.
